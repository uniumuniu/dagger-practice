# dagger-practice
This project is based on this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCYzUzKIBE8AOAspC3DHoBNZIBHbIOsC and the goal is to solidify my knowledge about Dagger 2 itself 
(without Hilt).
But...
I changed programming language from Java to Kotlin. Also there are some changes in the setup of Dagger, because Dagger is changing and this tutorial is rather old :)
